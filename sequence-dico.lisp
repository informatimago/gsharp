;;; is the object associated with the sequence, or nil
;;; if no such object exists.  The second value is a boolean 
;;; which is t if the first value is the object associated with
;;; the sequence and nil otherwise.  The third value is t
;;; if the sequence is a (not necessarily proper) prefix of a sequence 
;;; that has an associated object and nil otherwise.
